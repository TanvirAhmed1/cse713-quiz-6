q1. What is Run-Length Smoothing Algorithm (RLSA)?
a1: The Run Length Smoothing Algorithm (RLSA) is a method that can be used for Block segmentation and text discrimination. The method developed for the Document Analysis System consists of two steps. First, a segmentation procedure subdivides the area of a document into regions (blocks), each of which should contain only one type of data (text, graphic, halftone image, etc.). Next, some basic features of these blocks are calculated.

q3. What are Segmentation Algorithms?
a3: A segmentation algorithm can be viewed as a classification algorithm when it lebels the parts that are segmented.

q4. What is the use of Segmentation Algorithms?
a4: Segmentation algorithms can be applied to document images, to natural images, to medical images and also to 3D meshes.

q5. How many types of identifications of type of contents? Explain.
a5: There are two types of algorithms. They are, physical layout and logical layout. The physical layout relates to the nature of context such as text, typewritten text, graphics, diagram, picture etc. The logical layout relates to the function of context such as header, footnote, main body etc.  

q6. What is the main processing step of document analysis relies on?
a6: The main processing of document analysis depends on extracting or indexing the text that they contain.

q7. Is there any specific category for historical documents? Explain.
a7: There is no specific category for historical documents. Because all the categories on the figure contain both contemporary and historical documents.

q8. Why is there no specific category for historical documents?
a8: Defining a specific category for historical documents would require.

q9. What are the challenges of surveying technical documents or maps?
a9: The definition of what their layout is, is a challenge and they need specific tools to be analyzed.

q15. What are the clustering algorithms?
a15: They are bottom up algorithms and try to cluster elements based on geometric or texture or a more general 185 set of features.

q16. What are the algorithms based on function analysis?
a16: They mostly rely on function optimization e.g. trying to bring a function as close as possible to an objective value.

q17. What are the classification algorithms?
a17: they are trained to recognize the different types of elements based on a given set of features. As a consequence they need training and produce labeled elements. 195 The regions are made of adjacent elements having the same label hence they are bottom up algorithms.

q18. What algorithms are in group three?
a18: They try to overcome the limitations of the other algorithms by combining them or by using artificial intelligence. Thus they cannot be considered 200 as bottom-up or top-down algorithms.

q19. What are the subcategories of group three?
a19:  1. The hybrid algorithms combine several other algorithms in symbiosis: While they could potentially accumulate the strength of several other algorithms, some of them tend to be very complex without significant performance or versatility improvement.
2. The combination algorithm (only one has been presented) [115] combines the results of several algorithms to effectively improve them.
3. The neural network algorithms [15, 116] make use of artificial intelligence to automatically learn significant features and perform the required task.

q20. What is the layout constrained by the group one algorithm?
a20: The algorithms in this group are such that their internal mechanisms limit the variety

Segmentation based on hybrid techniques.
Segmentation based on algorithm combination.
Segmentation based on neural networks.

q23. What are the remarks on the applicability of the surveyed algorithms?
Ans: All segmentation algorithms are script independent e.g. their per565 formance does not depend on the language of the document. Many algorithms working on binary images assume that the image is the result of a thresholding process similar to Otsu binarization.

q24.  How was the evaluation of segmentation algorithms done?
Ans: Evaluating and comparing the performance of an algorithm is a dicult task. The authors
summarized here the current state of the art for the evaluation of document segmentation
algorithms. A first remark that can be made in the light of all the surveyed papers is that many authors tend to compare their algorithms with other algorithms based on 605 the same technique.

q25. What is the segmentation in document image analysis?
Ans: In document image analysis, segmentation is the task that identifies the regions of
a document. The increasing number of applications of document analysis requires a good knowledge of the available technologies.

q26. Name two of the first document segmentation algorithms.
Ans: Some first document image segmentation algorithms are,
Run-Length Smoothing Algorithm (RLSA)

q28. What is the scientific Scope of this survey?
Ans: Segmentation algorithms can be applied to document images but also to a set of
document images, to natural 40 images, to medical images and even to 3D meshes. More generally a segmentation algorithm can be viewed as a specific kind of clustering or partitioning algorithm or of classification algorithm when it labels the parts that are segmented.

q29. What are the two types of identifications?
Ans: The identifications are,
The Physical Layout
The Logical Layout
