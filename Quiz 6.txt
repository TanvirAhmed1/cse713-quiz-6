q1. What is Run-Length Smoothing Algorithm (RLSA)?
a1: The Run Length Smoothing Algorithm (RLSA) is a method that can 
be used for Block segmentation and text discrimination. The method 
developed for the Document Analysis System consists of two steps. 
First, a segmentation procedure subdivides the area of a document 
into regions (blocks), each of which should contain only one type 
of data (text, graphic, halftone image, etc.). Next, some basic 
features of these blocks are calculated.

q2. What is the X-Y cut algorithm?
a2: X-Y cut algorithm segments the document provided recursively 
in a stores the Segments blocks in a tree like structure to match 
for layout similarity from a dataset.

q3. What are Segmentation Algorithms?
a3: A segmentation algorithm can be viewed as a classification
 algorithm when it lebels the parts that are segmented.

q4. What is the use of Segmentation Algorithms?
a4: Segmentation algorithms can be applied to document 
images, to natural images, to medical images and also 
to 3D meshes.

q5. How many types of identifications of type of contents? Explain.
a5: There are two types of algorithms. They are, physical layout and 
logical layout. The physical layout relates to the nature of context 
such as text, typewritten text, graphics, diagram, picture etc. The 
logical layout relates to the function of context such as header, 
footnote, main body etc.  

q6. What is the main processing step of document analysis relies on?
a6: The main processing of document analysis depends on extracting 
or indexing the text that they contain.

a7: There is no specific category for historical documents. Because 
all the categories on the figure contain both contemporary and 
historical documents.

q8. Why is there no specific category for historical documents?
a8: Defining a specific category for historical documents would 
require.

q9. What are the challenges of surveying technical documents or maps?
a9: The definition of what their layout is, is a challenge and they 
need specific tools to be analyzed.

q10. What are the document image segmentation algorithm type groups?

geometric or texture or a more general 185 set of features.

q16. What are the algorithms based on function analysis?
a16: They mostly rely on function optimization e.g. trying to bring a 
function as close as possible to an objective value.

q17. What are the classification algorithms?
a17: they are trained to recognize the different types of elements 
based on a given set of features. As a consequence they need training 
and produce labeled elements. 195 The regions are made of adjacent 
elements having the same label hence they are bottom up algorithms.

q18. What algorithms are in group three?

Segmentation based on neural networks.

q23. What are the remarks on the applicability of the surveyed algorithms?
a23. All segmentation algorithms are script independent e.g. their per565 
formance does not depend on the language of the document. Many algorithms 
working on binary images assume that the image is the result of a thresholding 
process similar to Otsu binarization.

q24.  How was the evaluation of segmentation algorithms done?
a24. Evaluating and comparing the performance of an algorithm is a dicult task. 
The authors summarized here the current state of the art for the evaluation of 
document segmentation algorithms. A first remark that can be made in the light 
of all the surveyed papers is that many authors tend to compare their algorithms 
with other algorithms based on 605 the same technique.

q25. What is the segmentation in document image analysis?
a25. In document image analysis, segmentation is the task that identifies the 
regions of a document. The increasing number of applications of document 
analysis requires a good knowledge of the available technologies.

a28. Segmentation algorithms can be applied to document images but also to a set of
document images, to natural 40 images, to medical images and even to 3D meshes. 
More generally a segmentation algorithm can be viewed as a specific kind of clustering 
or partitioning algorithm or of classification algorithm when it labels the parts 
that are segmented.

The Physical Layout
The Logical Layout

labels or with a physical layout labeling.

q33. What are the use of algorithms for Grammer?
a33. There are five algorithms of this type. They were first published in 2006 by 
CoÂ¨uasnon and tested on a data set of 88745 documents which is an unrivaled data 
set size. He designed a layout grammar language called DMOS. This language can 
describe any layout and the associated parser recognizes this layout in an image.

q34. What are the use of algorithms for Projection profiles?
a34. There are 7 algorithms of this type and the two CASIA algorithms published
in. Ouwayed and Belaid use projection profiles to segment multi-240 oriented, 
text only documents. They make a paving of the document with rectangles.
Then they compute the projection profile of each rectangle along several directions.
The direction with the highest maximum ofWigner-Ville distribution is that of the text.

q35. What is Segmentation based on filtering algorithms?
a35. These algorithms usually use specific predefined filters to segment a given type of
content. They frequently rely on assumptions that the text lines are straight and/or
horizontal.

q36. Discuss Mathemathical morphology.
a36. Six algorithms using mathematical morphology have been published. Bockholt
et al. use several combinations of erosion and dilation to eciently identify
successively the pictures, the graphics and the text. While being a basic type of processing
it proves very ecient for the task of document retrieval.265 Ferili et al. 
replace the logical AND of RLSA by an OR. This makes thealgorithm more computationally 
ecient as only one run length is performed. They make the assumption that the 
text is horizontal. An interesting addition is the extensionof the algorithm to 
natively digital documents based on their basic blocks.

q37. What do you mean by Filtering?
q37. The only contribution for this kind of algorithm was done by Shi et al. It
was reused by A2iA in a competition where it was ranked third out of 7 partici275
pants. The method is based on steerable filters to detect text lines along five 
orientations. A heuristic post processing is used to solve the issue of connected 
components spanning several lines.

q38. Explain Segmentation based on straight line identification algorithms.
a38. Three contributions are based on straight line identification. Louloudis
280 et al. split the connected components horizontally into blocks based on the average
character height. This allows the algorithm to work on handwritten text where
several characters are merged into one connected component. However the horizontal
partitioning assumes that the text is also horizontal. Once this partitioning is done, they
apply a Hough transform on the centers of gravity of each block to detect text lines.

q39. What is geometric only clustering?
a39. The vast majority of clustering algorithms uses only geometric
features. Before further classifying them based on the color information level they
305 can process, we can highlight the contribution of the Fraunhofer Institute and the team
of Konya et al. who made several contributions to the field and participated in every
document segmentation competition and won two of them.

q40. What do you mean by black and white algorithms?
a40. Most of them only process black and white images. Liu et al. use a Gaussian 
Mixture model to classify 310 connected component triplets as text or non text. 
They use three geometric features  and thus have trivariate Gaussian distributions. 
The first order neighborhood of a connected component is computed with the Delaunay 
triangulation and they use the second order neighbors to obtain all the possible 
triplets. They also use a specific training called MMS which maximizes the class 
separability.
